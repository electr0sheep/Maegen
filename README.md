# Credits
- The file maegenThacker.py was written by [Isaiah Thacker](https://github.com/ThackerCI).
- The file maegen.py represents the changes I made to the original maegenThacker.py

- The music, sounds, and images for the "slingers" came from Dune II
- The music for the swordsman came from Quest for Glory 5
- The sounds and images for the swordsman came from Warcraft II

# Dependencies
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Easel.py](https://github.com/qianji/Easel_PY)

# How to use
Easel is by no means easy and straightforward to use.
Here is how I got it working (Mac OS 10.12.1)
- Open a terminal window and type ```idle3```
- Make sure the IDLE shell is the active window (You will see Python next to the Apple logo)
- From the top menu select File->Open...
- Open Easel.py
- From the new window that was created when you opened Easel.py, select Run->Run Module.
- Going back to the IDLE shell window (the original one) type ```play('maegen')```
